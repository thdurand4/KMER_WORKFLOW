Today, get an assembly of large polyploid genome is very complicated and it's hard to compare lot of individuals of this polyploid species, in particular to compare sequences of many individuals.

Due to the daily deluge of data sequences the number of data increase and need to be analyse ...

KMER_WORKFLOW is is an open-source, scalable, modulable and traceable snakemake pipeline, able to compare multiple data short read (NGS) obtained from illumina sequencing by counting the number of shared kmers. The workflow KMER_WORKFLOW can help you to find which individuals share sequences informations to other.
